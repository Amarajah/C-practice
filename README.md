# C-practice
A collection of my c practice programs

First one is a 24-hour digital clock I made. You set the time, and the program does the rest
Second is a 24-hour countdown timer. 
You input values for the hour, minute and second you want to countdown to, the program takes care of the rest for you
Infact once the timer hits 00:00:00, there's a beep to alert you
